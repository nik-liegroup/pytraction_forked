# pytraction
Bayesian Traction Force Microscopy

**Motivation**: TFM data is annoying, disperse tool set (all in matlab / java / javascript)

**PyTraction**: Modern software and easy to use end-to-end

**Contributing**: Think of [Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation#:~:text=Big%20O%20notation%20is%20a,a%20particular%20value%20or%20infinity.) and [Occam's_razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor)



#### TO-DO

:heavy_check_mark: Base PIV

:heavy_check_mark: Allign stacks

:heavy_check_mark: Finish writing bayesian TFM functions [from matlab implementation](https://github.com/CellMicroMechanics/Easy-to-use_TFM_package)

:clock9:  train vanilla efficentnet CNN to get cell outline

- [ ] implement NMT for filtering U, V vectors

- [ ] end-to-end testing


## Installation
I've not yet included the reqs so this will be broken and you'll need to install a few libs manually for now

```git clone git@github.com:rg314/pytraction.git```


Create conda env

```
conda create -n pytraction python=3.8
```

Install autoballs in editable mode

```
pip install -e .
```

For commiting big code blocks please relate them to issues and create a new branch. The branch name as the abbriviated issue (issue8 = iss8). 

```git checkout -b iss8```

Commit to current branch and assign a reviewer when merging pull request into main branch from the webapp.

## Example
From inital testing it is possible to pass input x,y,u,v into the function and the matlab implementation can be reproduced

```python run_matlab.py```
